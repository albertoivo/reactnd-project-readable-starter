# Front-end

This is the Frontend project for the final assesment of Udacity React Course. I built a content and comment web app for my personal `Travel Blog Nossas Rotas`.

To install and start the frontend, run the following commands in this directory:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

PS: Please note that you also have to run the `api-server`.

To run the frontend tests, run the following commands inside the `api-server` directory:

* `npm install`
* `node server`

With the api-server running, in another terminal window and inside `frontend` directory, run the following commands:

* `npm test`

## Contribute

You can help to improve the project by opening Pull Requests (PR) and Issues.

In addition, you can open Issues when you run into problems. In order to make the fix for the Issue as easy as possible, please provide a couple of details such as error log, screenshot, your node version (command line: `node -v`) and a link to your own repository. Not all of these details are mandatory, but most of them help to fix the Issue and to improve.
